    "## Assignment week 05: Sleeping habits\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **week five** of this course programming 1. You will learn about analysing data with pandas and numpy and you will learn to visualize with bokeh. Concretely, you will preprocess the Sleep Study data in an appropiate format in order to conduct statistical and visual analysis. Learning outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is collected from a survey-based study of the sleeping habits of individuals within the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a description of each of the variables contained within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enough = Do you think that you get enough sleep?\n",
    "- Hours = On average, how many hours of sleep do you get on a weeknight?\n",
    "- PhoneReach = Do you sleep with your phone within arms reach?\n",
    "- PhoneTime = Do you use your phone within 30 minutes of falling asleep?\n",
    "- Tired = On a scale from 1 to 5, how tired are you throughout the day? (1 being not tired, 5 being very tired)\n",
    "- Breakfast = Do you typically eat breakfast?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two research questions you should answer in this assignment are:\n",
    "1. Is there a differences in Hours sleep caused by having breakfast (yes, no)?\n",
    "2. Is there a differences in Hours sleep caused by having breakfast and the tireness (score)\n",
    "\n",

    "The assignment consists of 6 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [part 1: load the data](#0)\n",
    "- [part 2: data inspection](#1)\n",
    "- [part 3: check assumptions](#2)\n",

    "   - [check equal variance 3.2](#ex-32)\n",
    "- [part 4: prepare the data](#3)\n",
    "- [part 5: answer the research question](#4)\n",
    "- [part 6: enhanced plotting](#5)\n",

    "Part 1 till 5 are mandatory, part 6 is optional (bonus)\n",

    "\n",
    "Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the variances between groups versus within groups. It basically determines whether the differences between groups is larger than the differences within a group (the noise). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In ANOVA, the dependent variable must be a continuous (interval or ratio) level of measurement. For instance Glucose level. The independent variables in ANOVA must be categorical (nominal or ordinal) variables. For instance trial category, time of day (AM versus PM) or time of trial (different categories). Like the t-test, ANOVA is also a parametric test and has some assumptions. ANOVA assumes that the data is normally distributed.  The ANOVA also assumes homogeneity of variance, which means that the variance among the groups should be approximately equal. ANOVA also assumes that the observations are independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "A one-way ANOVA has just one independent variable. A two-way ANOVA (are also called factorial ANOVA) refers to an ANOVA using two independent variables. For research question 1 we can use the one-way ANOVA, for research question two we can use two-way ANOVA. But first we need to check the assumptions. \n"
