    "\n",
    "Welcome to **week three** of this course programming 1. You will learn about combining data with pandas and numpy and you will learn to visualize with bokeh. Concretely, you will preprocess the partly Synthetic Covid data in an appropiate format in order to conduct statistical and visual analysis. Learning outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load a tabular dataset\n",
    "- Inspect the dataset for quality and metadata information\n",
    "- Combine data from several tables into one dataframe\n",
    "- Subselect specific data from dataframes\n",
    "- Reshape the dataset into a format suitable for visual and statistical analysis\n",
    "- Visualize data using bokeh \n",
    "- Use widgets to make the plot interactive (optional)\n",
    "- Use geomap to plot locations (optional)\n",

    "The data is generated by Synthea's COVID-19 module. The data was constructed using three peer-reviewed publications published in the early stages of the global pandemic, when less was known, along with emerging resources, data, publications, and clinical knowledge. The simulation outputs synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR), including the daily consumption of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other medical devices and supplies. For this assignment the `conditions`, `patients`, `observations`, `careplans` and `encounters` table will be used. The Data is stored in separate tables to avoid redundancy, with as a concequence that tables need to be combined and reorganized in dataframes for analysing purpose.\n",
